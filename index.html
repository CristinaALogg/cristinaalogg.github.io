		<p>As a planner fascinated by how to solve for and plan for environmental problems, many of which are exacerbated by climate change, in an urban context,
		the hurricane that Houston last year was particularly interesting. After Hurricane Harvey, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/24/us/hurricane-harvey-texas.html"> the New York Times<a/> published a fascinating article showing,
		via a variety of graphics, how Houston was impacted by Harvey and its devastating rainfall. Two graphics are pictured below with the first showing,
	 	at one point in time, how much rain had fallen in the Houston area. The second shows shelters and their associated capacity in the Houston region.</p>
